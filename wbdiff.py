# wbdiff.py - sophisticated diff utility
#
# Copyright: Witold Baryluk, 2013

#
# This is simplistic tool for detecting moved blocks
# and edits of code in text files.
#
# It can be used just like normal diff utility, but it additionally
# supports line movement detection, fuzzy matching, colored output,
# collapsing very long runs of similar lines / moves
# and runs up much slower.
#
# Algorithm is O(k*n^2*l^2), where k is context lenght, n number
# of lines, l lenght of lines.
#
# If no fuzzy matching is used, then algorithm is basically O(n^2*l).
#
# There are multiple features on the horizon, like automatic compressed
# files support, adaptative context length estimation, white space removal,
# custom replacments matching,
# speed optimizations for case of small number of block movements,
# side-by-side comparission (console and HTML)
# and graphical visualizer (using GraphViz probably) and GUI frontend.
#
# If you want to pipe output to less, use less -RS
#
# This script runs in 0.165 seconds on my benchmark (300 lines),
# compared to 0.019 seconds by diff -U 300 (unified diff, with big context).
#
# Difference is big, but this program should be usable for manual execution
# with files of about 5000 lines. For patches, and automatic execution
# classic diff algorithm is probably better because of O(n) algorithm used.
#
# Similar good programs, which can align codes in non-sequential manner:
#  WinDiff by Microsoft (free, comes with source code, runs under Windows, and WINE)
#    - very good results, but old UI
#  WinMerge (free open-source, for Windows, runs also on WINE, native port in preparation
#    - modern UI, but results are inferior
#  Araxis Merge by Araxis (commercial, for Windows, Mac OS X and WINE, with trial)
#    - very poor results
#    - even more advanced UI, but even more bad results, sometimes completly useless
#
# Other tools checked, which essentially doesn't support moved blocks detecion:
#   BeyondCompare by Scooter Software, Inc. (Mac OS X, Linux)
#   P4Merge: Visual Merge Tool by Perfore (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)
#   DeltaWalker by Deltopia (Mac OS X, Windows, Linux)
#   DiffMerge by SourceGear (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux)
#   Code Compare by Devart (Windows)
#   ECMerge by Ellie Computing (Windows,Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris)
#   Compare It! by Grig Software (Windows)
#   Synchronize It! by Grig Software (Windows)
#   ExamDiff Pro by prestoSoft (Windows)
#   Open source: Meld, KDiff3, tkdiff, Advanced Diff (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X)
#
# Pretty sad, so many tools, non does main job good.
#
# I may think about creating GUI ala Meld, WinMerge, KDiff3 or Araxis Merge.
# I will probably use GTK+ (version 3), so stay tuned.
