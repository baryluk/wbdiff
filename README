This tool was created on one evening, when I was uterly annoyed by lack
of good diff tools. I checked about 15 of them, and actually Microsoft's
free version WinDiff was best (running in WINE)! However, I wanted
simple tool, with ability to work from command line nativly on Linux,
and more possible customizations. Then in few hours I created wbdiff.py :)
Works perfectly for me, producing optimal diffs.
