Diffing tool with few sophisticated features, hopefully makeing
developer's life easier.

Features:
  - detection of moved code bloks
  - shortening long blocks
  - color output
  - statistics
  - normalization of lines
  - ability to ignore certain types changes
  - fuzzy matching
  - custom parameters
  - slowness

TODO:
  - adaptative moved blocks and fuzzy matching
  - splited/merged lines detection
  - automatic handing of compressed files
  - recurisve diffing of multiple files/directories
  - speed optimizations


This tool was created on one evening, when I was uterly annoyed by lack
of good diff tools. I checked about 15 of them, and actually Microsoft's
free version WinDiff was best (running in WINE)! However, I wanted
simple tool, with ability to work from command line nativly on Linux,
and more possible customizations. Then in few hours I created wbdiff.py :)
Works perfectly for me, producing optimal diffs.
